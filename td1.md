# TD1: Use basic Linux commands

## Exericice 1

1.  Go to the root directory
```
cd /
```
cd signifie change directory et / représente le root directory

2.  Display the content of the current (root) directory
```
ls -a
```

3. Check your current location
```
pwd
```

4.  Try to create a directory named test
```
mkdir test
```
output: cannot create directory ‘test’: Permission denied

5.  Go to the general home directory (should contain folders named after
each user)
```
cd /home
```

6.  Go to your home directory
```
cd 
cd ~
```
Les deux commandes précédentes sont équivalentes
Cela revient à faire cd /home/dylanriboulet

7. Go back to the general home directory (located "just above")
```
cd ..
```

8. retourner en arrière
```
cd ..
```
pour remonter au fichier qui est juste au dessus
permet de remonter jusqu'à la racine

9. Go directly to your home directory (named after you). It should be a
very simple command, which take no name as parameter of the path
```
cd
```

10. Try to create a directory named test
```
mkdir test
```
Commentaire : pas de messages en sortie

11. Go into this new directory
```
cd test
```

12. Check your current location
```
pwd
```
output: /home/dylanriboulet/test
